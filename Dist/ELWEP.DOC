 WHAT IS EMPIRE OF THE PEASANTS?

 Empire of the Peasants is a game of war and economics.  Each player
 must build their empire from the ground up.   Players clash on the
 battlefield to fight over their empires.  Players must also keep a close
 watch on their taxation rate and their grain and coin production.
 If grain production falls short of that required by the serfs and soldiers,
 they will surely starve.  A player caught severely neglecting their serfs
 and soldiers will undoubtedly be beheaded!
 
 GAMEPLAY

 There are several added features to this version. First off, there is a
 new "MESSAGE CENTER". The message center allows you to send private "page"
 type messages to other users (internal to EOP). The message center also
 allows you to send single line "courier" messages to other players. These
 single line courier messages are also sent internally by EOP to players
 to notify them of situations (like battle results, etc). The main goal
 of the message centers "Leave a message" option is to provide users with
 notification of important events.
 
 Secondly, there are four new "users" internal to the pub now. You can use
 the LOOK command for information on these characters - along with the
 normal players. The number of characters that show up each time you
 use the LOOK command is random (possibility of 4 at one time). You can use
 normal action commands with these "internal" users to generate responces
 from them. Profanity does not go over well with these "internal" users.
 
 Next, the flow of EOP has changed for the better. When you select the
 "C"ontinue option, you will answer "Y"es or "N"o if you wish to
 buy/sell grain/land. Selecting "N"o will send you on to the
 distribution of grain to serfs and soldiers. The EOP market place prices
 are now level 4 configurable.

 GAME HISTORY
 
 Empire of the Peasants was developed by MagiComm.  The game was based upon
 several other POLitical/ECONomic simulations popular on single-user BBSes as
 well as on Galacticomm systems.  
 
 The game was sold to Logicom when MagiComm went out of business in the early
 1990s, and hasn't been available since. Don Arnel transferred the game to
 Elwynor Technologies in June 2007.
 
 Elwynor Technologies ported the game to Worldgroup 3.2 in June 2012.
 
 The game was ported to Major BBS V10 in May 2023.
