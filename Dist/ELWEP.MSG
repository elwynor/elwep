GENERAL INFORMATION
[[[1;37m|]
Empire of the Peasants - EOP for short - is a game of economics and
war. EOP allows users to build up their own personal kingdom,
protect themselves from their foes, and to attack other unsuspecting
rulers in the game.

If you don't grow as quickly as other players you may find yourself
starting over from scratch. Type [[[33m|]HELP GROWTH[[[37m|] for information on how to
build up your Empire.

RANKS
[[[1;37m|]
In Empire of the Peasants (EOP) rank is calculated by the extent
of your growth. The more land, markets, mills, etc. you own, the
better chances you have of being promoted to the next rank. Study
the following chart to learn the exact amounts required for a rank:

STRATEGY
[[[1;37m|]
To get ahead in Empire of the Peasants (EOP) you must keep on top
of the situation. Buying markets and mills will give you an edge
over other players. Certain "ratios" must be met before markets and
mills can be purchased; so pay close attention!

Be sure to get as many acres as possible. Don't try to grow TOO quickly,
however, or your serfs may become too much to handle. You can only own
two serfs per acre, so, be sure to pay close attention to the needs
of your serfs!

If you end up with a few extra dollars at the end of a turn: spend them
on defense. You never know when someone may attack you!

Try to weaken your opponents palace before going through with a full
fledged assult. More of your men may survive!

TAXES
[[[1;37m|]
Taxes have an effect on the way Empire of the Peasants (EOP) operates
turn by turn. The higher the tax rate (50% is the highest, 1% is the
lowest) the less grain and money you will make each turn from your
peasants. On the other hand, a high tax rate will cause alot more
income to be earned per turn, but less grain.

In the beginning you should probably keep your tax rate as low as
possible so you make more grain per turn. If grain becomes less of
a problem then increase taxes.

BATTLE
[[[1;37m|]
Empire of the Peasants supports two different methods of Battle. The
methods available are ATTACK, and CONQUER.

  RETREAT causes a player to "run" from battle; damage may or may
not be caused to that player while retreating.

  ATTACK will launch a full scale attack on the ground forces of
the opponent. Soldiers (Hand to Hand combat) is performed. A winner
of the battle is calculated in just a few moments after initiating
the attack.

  CONQUER will cause the ground forces of the aggressor to be sent
to destroy parts of the opponents palace. For more information on
how the palace comes into play, enter [[[33m|]HELP PALACE[[[37m|].

A percentage of the opponents nobles and land will be awarded to the
aggressor if a successful attack is launched. A loss of forces will
occur if the attack fails!

PURCHASES
[[[1;37m|]
The Empire of the Peasants (EOP) market houses all the great tools
you will need to play EOP. To purchase a product, while at the
market menu,  use the format 'Buy <quantity> <product>'.

Examples include:

buy 200 markets
buy 50 mills

Product names can be abbreviated!

HLP12 {[[[35m|]
GROWTH
[[[1;37m|]
To grow in Empire of the Peasants (EOP) you must gain Markets
and Mills. Mills provide you with Grain to feed your serfs and
soldiers. Markets, Foundries, and shipyards provide you with money
to help pay for your needs. Foundries and shipyards produce the
best results, but are also the most expensive. Be sure to grow as
quickly and steadily as possible or your opponents may get the
best of you!

It is a good idea to spend money on your defense (SOLDIERS and NOBLES)
as often as possible. Failing to increase your defense will make you
an easy win (or kill).

You must keep a ratio of two serfs per acre of land, two mills per
market, and one market per acre of land. If you fail to keep any
of these ratios satisfied, it could result in the loss of your life!
} T Empire Help #12: Growth


HLP13 {[[[35m|]
PROTECTION
[[[1;37m|]
To help stay alive as long as possible - invest in soldiers
and nobles. You are permitted to own 20 soldiers per noble you
own. Until you meet the ratio, you're not permitted to purchase
more soldiers. The more soldiers you have: the better DEFENSE
you have. When attacking other players, be sure to attack with
as many soldiers as you can muster!

If another player is able to defeat your forces, you will lose
atleast ONE noble to your opponent. To help hinder your opponent,
build up your PALACE. For more information, type [[[33m|]HELP PALACE[[[37m|].

TURNS

Every time you complete the cycle associated with the "C"ontinue
option, you complete a turn. The more turns you complete; the tougher
Empire of the Peasants (EOP) becomes. More grain will be required
from you. The best approach is to complete as much as possible per
turn. The less turns you complete, the easier your game will be to play!

To achieve a higher rank, however, you must complete a required number
of turns per rank. Type [[[33m|]HELP RANKS[[[37m|] for more information on rank
